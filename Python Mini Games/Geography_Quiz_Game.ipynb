    "### üìå Game Rules\n",
    "A quiz game about **geography questions**, built in Python.  \n",
    "The player has a limited number of attempts to answer correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The player must answer random geography questions.  \n",
    "- **Winning condition**: 5 correct answers.  \n",
    "- **Losing condition**: 3 incorrect answers.  \n",
    "- Each player starts with **5 correct attempts available** and **3 wrong attempts allowed**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Implementation Hints\n",
    "1. Create a dictionary that stores questions as keys and answers as values.  \n",
    "2. Use `random.choice` to select a random question.  \n",
    "3. Track both correct and incorrect attempts with counters (`correct_attempts = 5`, `wrong_attempts = 3`).  \n",
    "4. Use a `while` loop to continue asking questions until one of the end conditions is met.  \n",
    "5. Check if the answer matches, update counters accordingly, and print feedback.  \n",
    "6. Exit the loop and declare win or loss when conditions are met.  \n"
